# Micro-Reddit

### Description

This program is designed to create users, posts and comments through `rails console` which is an interface for rails to SQLite through Active Records. For instance, to create a new user you could do `u1 = User.new(username: 'xxxx', email'xxxxx')` and the same syntax to add a Post or Comments.

> This is a solution to the [Odin project lesson: Micro-Reddit](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails).
